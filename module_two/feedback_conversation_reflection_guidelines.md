# Feedback II Reflection

* Date of feedback conversation: 

   - 5/10/17

* How did you prepare for the conversation? 

   - I prepared these talking points:
     - I like how the team handled the come together moments and find a consensus or choose a direction when encountering a problem
     - We split up work and worked together in the most effective way we saw at the time
     - We got very got at proper Git work flow
     - Would have liked more time to do the extensions like Google Charts and Heroku

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 

  - Conversation went well. We were on the same page. We got along well so the conversation was easy to have. We checked in and discussed throughout the project.

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

  - We were straightforward with each other. Discussed how things could have been better for future projects.

* Any other comments:
