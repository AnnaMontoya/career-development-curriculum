# Agile Practices & Software Collaboration

## Connections: The Why
....

All the things:
* Why...
* Waterfall vs. Agile
  * Intro the manifesto but mention that we'll come back to it later to discuss its merits and flaws -- this will be about students being able to take ownership of their learning in the software industry
  * Turn & Talk: how do you already see agile being used in your processes at Turing? 
* What Agile looks like as a process
* Project Management tools & resources (waffle, XP, Git Workflow, etc.)
* How teams work together (Tuckman's, SCRUM, Honesty, Treating team members as more than just the work they do, Goal Setting, Accountability, Retrospective and review)
  * Bring in readings??
  * Strengths leadership here?
* Discussions:
  * Build own "manifesto" or principles on how teams should work
* Project group break-outs:
  * Discuss strengths leadership domains and what systems you'll put into place
* Final takeaway: how will you continue to apply these days during the rest of your time at Turing?

### Session Structure

Length: 90 minutes

* Opening: objectives, deliverable, why (5-6 mins)
* Waterfall vs. Agile (6 mins)
   * Turn & Talk (5 mins)
   * Whole Group share-out (3 mins)
* 

### Objectives (Jeff & Allison)
* Describe the general concept of the "waterfall" model
* Explain how "agile" differs from waterfall
* Explain the idea of a sprint
* Write a story following a template
*


### Deliverable (Allison)
By Monday of Week 6, submit a written reflection on:
* Describe plan to utilize agile as a process at Turing -- what were you already doing, what did you put into place in M2...
* Reflections on how you're a leader and a teammate, reflecting on your strengths

* Description of the role you played in pair/group projects this module & how you utilized your leadership skills
* What agile practices you used in your projects this module; what was effective? What do you want to improve on in future proejcts?

### Opening (Jeff & Allison)
Discuss the why / provide a hook -- relating to teamwork...

To build great software we need to be intentional about the **process**. Whether working solo or in groups, your process is a more significant determiner of your project's success than your technical skill.



In this session we'll take a quick overview of "Waterfall," "Agile," how to begin better managing your projects at Turing, and how to build even better teams. 

### Waterfall vs. Agile (Jeff)

#### Waterfall
1. Requirements - the big book of features
2. Technical Design - "architects"
3. Implementation - "code monkeys"
4. Verification - handoff to Q/A
5. Maintenance - let interns fix the bugs
 
#### Strengths of Waterfall

* Once requirements are set, you can estimate how long it'll take to build. But...you're wrong.
* Easy to stagger teams, have one hand off to the next each phase
* Spend a long time in 1 & 2 billing clients and you don't have to build anything
* When the project fails you blame the requirements and those people are long gone
 
#### Turn & Talk:
* What are benefits/downsides to both Waterfall and Agile?
* How do you see Agile already being used in your processes at Turing?

1-3 groups share out takeaways to the whole group. 

### Agile in Practice (Jeff)
* The Sprint
* Intro to Stories
* Student Practice: Writing a story

### Project Management Tools (Jeff)
* Git Workflow
* Waffle

#### What This Can Look Like at Turing (Jeff)
* Turn your requirements into stories following this template
* Prioritize stories and schedule sprints (even just 2-3 days)
* Deploy to production, maybe solicit feedback from "users"
* Cutting scope is okay, cutting quality isn't

### How Teams Work Together (Allison)
Let's talk now about how teams work together....

#### Turn & Talk

* What has made your previous teams successful? What has made them difficult?
* When working together for the first time, what can you do/have you done to make sure your team is productive?

2 groups share out from their discussions.
