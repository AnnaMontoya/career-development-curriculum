# Feedback III (Module Two, Week Four)

## Facilitator Guide

### Prep
Prior to the session, send out a Slack message to the cohorts to have them log into the Johari Window app using this link: https://johariwindow.herokuapp.com/
* Notes: the link needs to include “https://” and students must log in with GitHub
* Depending on how much time you’ll need to create the partner groups for the session, you may want to send that message out sooner

You’ll need to create groups for each student on the app with the people they’ve worked in projects with, both in M1 and M2. You’ll probably want to track this on a spreadsheet first and then create the groups in the app. For your reference, here are the paired or group projects that you’ll need to include:
 * B1: 
  * M1 paired project #1 (varies)
  * Black Thursday
  * Bike Share
 * F1:
  * Linked List
  * IdeaBox
  * 2DoBox
  * Game Time

You can find the partners from these projects in this [repo](https://github.com/turingschool/roster/tree/master/data); however, instructors do not always update this, so you may have to do some investigating, using both the M1 feedback sheets and anything posted in the instructor and/or cohort channels to let you know who’s paired with whom. *For any students who have paired with students who are repeating a previous module or have withdrawn from the program, don’t worry about including them in the groups*

### Session Outcomes

* Students are able to analyze their reactions and feelings about feedback
* Students are able to discuss and apply the Right & Wrong Spotting Technique to feedback reflections
* Students are able to use the Johari Window technique to recognize their own blind spots
* Students are able to create goals for how to improve their collaboration practices
