Date of feedback conversation: 8/24/17

I prepared for this conversation (part of the group feedback) by really trying to
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each of my team members beforehand. But,
more specifically, I did my best to assertain what went wrong on my end and how I
could've communicated and worked better with my team to uphold my end of the project.
This conversation was difficult for me, because I knew that I had let my team down.
Functionally, my end was there, but it seemed haphazard, unconnected to the rest of
the application, and was not properly styled. I felt an immense sense of failure
and guilt. When myself giving feedback, I tried to be as appreciative as possible
and refrain from attacking anyone's decisions. There were misunderstandings and
conflict in our group, and I attempted to rationalize them and provide an objective
viewpoint on the situation. I would also like to add that I got some very constructive
feedback from my teammate Brendon, who, while it was acknowledged that I could have
done better, advised me to look towards the future instead of ruminating on the past.
Therefore, that is what I intend to do.
