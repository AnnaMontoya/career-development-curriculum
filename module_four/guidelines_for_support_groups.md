# Module Four Professional Development Support Group Guidelines

## Overview
Welcome to Module Four! This is when you’ll kick your job search into high gear, and to assist with that, you will meet with your peer support group each Tuesday to discuss strategies and find ways to hold each other accountable. A Turing staff member will also be available as a coach to help your group stay on track and offer advice when needed. 

## Potential topics for your group to discuss:
* Outreach emails: write emails together, give feedback on each other’s emails before sending them out
* Coffee meetings: what questions do you want to make sure to ask? Create a list in your group
* Networking events: what meetups are coming up? Who can you connect with at them? Make a plan to attend a meetup together
* Storytelling: practice your elevator pitch with each other and provide feedback 
* Blogging: discuss ideas for posts, peer review, and how you can use a blog post to increase visibility
* Pooling your resources: what leads or tips can you share with each other?
