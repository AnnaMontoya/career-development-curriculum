# Module Four Professional Development Support Group Guidelines

## Overview
Welcome to Module Four! This is when you’ll kick your job search into high gear, and to assist with that, you will meet with your peer support group each Tuesday to discuss strategies and find ways to hold each other accountable. A Turing staff member will also be available as a coach to help your group stay on track and offer advice when needed. 

## Potential topics for your group to discuss:

   * Write emails together

## Accountability -- what does this look like for your group? 
Here are some suggestions:
* Start each Tuesday meeting with a Stand Up to give updates on your job search action steps
* Create a Slack channel to post updates in throughout the week when you’re not meeting with each other
* Identify what motivates you and share with your group how they can support that motivation
* Share your barriers with your group as you come across them so that they can help you move past them
* 

## How to utilize your coaches:
* Keep them updated. Let them know your needs at any given time -- what questions do you have? Where is your group getting stuck? What advice do you need?
