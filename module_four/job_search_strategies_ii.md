[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15x2PaHDMICCjxBnKsMMlykp3xWsInDfwlyW3y9yKkwA/edit?usp=sharing)

### Session Structure

Length: 60 minutes

* Opening (10 mins)
* Recap of Barriers (
* Long Term Career Visioning
* Group Discussion (18 mins)



* Whole Group Share Out & Synthesis (10 mins)
* Plan Work Time (20 mins)

Some things to consider:

* What do you envision for your career?
* What do you want your 2nd and 3rd jobs to look like?
* How do you want to be involved with the Turing community? The greater developer community?
* Where do your passions lie?

## Longterm Career Plan: What are your career goals?
Where do you want to go in your career? 

Reflect on this [narrative rule described by Emma Coats, former Pixar story artist](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar):

	Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. 
	Endings are hard, get yours working up front.
	
1. Imagine that it's 5 years from now - what have you accomplished during that time? How is your life different? What steps did you take to achieve your goals?


2. Create a vision statement for these longterm goals.

	Guidelines for writing your vision statement:

	* Make your statements stretching, challenging, and interrupting of the status quo.
	* Write in the future tense (I will...)
	* Is the statement grounded -- have you been able to demonstrate something similar in the past?


3. Reference what you outlined in your Flower Exercise -- what preferred level of responsibility do you want to move to? Do you want to start your own company? What kind of work do you see yourself doing longterm? In your first year on the job, what skills do you want to develop to work towards your longterm goals?



### Objectives
* Identify areas where you might place barriers on yourself in terms of the job search
* Devise an action plan to overcome those barriers
* Create an updated action plan for your job search (you will use this plan when meeting with Meg)
* Envision your longterm career path to align your job search
* Create a schedule for completing your goals

### Deliverable
The deliverable out of today's session is an [action plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md) -- both for your current job search and defining your longterm career goals. There is also an optional part of the plan in which you can strategize other ways you would like to grow and contribute to the developer community. 

You will need to complete and submit this plan to Meg for any post-grad job search support from her. Remember, this action plan is a draft and will likely change. That is okay. But you need to start somewhere. 

### Opening
You're here to embark on a new and satisfying career -- not just to find a job. But we recognize where you are right now -- you've been in this program for almost 7+ months now, and you're ready to be back at work. This urgency can create all kinds of emotions, some of which are helpful for the job search and some of which aren't. Today, we'll discuss continuing to create strategies and longterm goals in order to navigate this scary/exciting time in a meaningful and successful way. The most important thing to remember is that you're not alone in this -- there are lots of tools available to you for you to utilize.

Let's start by sharing how you've been managing the job search during this module. 

**Turn & Talk:** Turn to the person next to you to share updates on your job search:

* How has your job search gone during this module? 
* Did you find that you were able to use the plan you outlined at the end of Module 3?
* Where have you focused your priorities? 
* What's been successful for you?

**Whole Group Shareout:**
2-3 partners share out

* What strategies have been successful?
* What got in the way?

### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Cold Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture fit)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

#### Group Discussion
Get into groups of 3-4 people to discuss job search barriers. Everyone will get 2 minutes to describe what job search barriers they identify with, and then for 10 minutes, as a group, discuss possible strategies and action steps for overcoming those barriers. The goal here is to vocalize what could hold us back in the job search in order to increase accountability within your cohort and also help each other find solutions.

Please assign a timekeeper, a notetaker, and a presenter. At the end of this discussion, each group will present out a 1-2 barriers discussed and what action steps will move them past those barriers.

#### Whole Group Share Out & Synthesis
Each group's presenter will have 2 minutes to present the barriers they discussed and their proposed action steps. 


### Start Planning
Take the rest of the session to work on your deliverable. 

**Goal-setting Tips:** Spend thirty minutes each day and an hour each week assessing how your tasks align with your goals. Make adjustments as needed and be:

* Flexible
* Kind to yourself
* Realistic with your time

Put your plan into a gist to share with Meg. Here's an [example](https://gist.github.com/kjs222/7ef5e79a71eedf9d8c8d401da1e687c7) of what this can look like for your reference. 

After graduation, you should still set up 1-on-1s with Meg regularly to discuss your search progress. You can schedule time with Meg [here](https://megstew.youcanbook.me/index.jsp) and the password is *complete*.
