You are so close! You've spent the last 7 months working towards this -- graduation and finding your new dream job! This plan is meant to help you streamline your goals and get on the path to employment as a software developer as quickly as possible. Please fill out the plan by copying this template into a gist to submit in your portfolio. 

As you fill out this plan, consider how your first job search will set the tone for your career trajectory in the software industry. After all, your first developer job should align with those goals as well so that you're on track for a longterm successful career. 

**Note:** If you have already secured a job prior to graduation, skip to the second part of the plan below.  

## #1: Job Search Action Plan
### Create a schedule & goals
Design a 40-hour "work week" that provides time for: 
	* Code (ideally, 2-4 hours a day will be dedicated to coding)
	* Outreach & Networking
	* Job & company research 
	* Interview Prep
	* Housekeeping (updating your resume, writing cover letters, updating your Turing profile)
	* Other (social networking, blogging, planning talks, etc.)

How much time will you spend on each? When will you do each thing?

1. **Action Step:** Establish a shareable calendar (like Google Calendar) and block out time on your calendar *now* to adhere to these goals. At the end of each week, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. This will also help you keep a record of what you've done in your job search. 

2. **Action Step:** Backwards plan for your big goal. What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?


3. **Action Step:** Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals to reach in order to reach your big goal.

Keep in mind:

* What is feasible in your schedule?
* What actions will give you the most impact in your search?

### Coding
For time spent coding, consider what skills would you like to improve or develop? Are there areas from Turing's program that you feel weaker in? How will you level up? Are there new languages or technologies you'd like to learn? How and when will you do that?

**Action Step:** Establish a “daily-practice” repository where you’re putting small daily exercises to keep your skills sharp and your GitHub activity chart active





5. What "barriers" tend to hold you back in the job search? What steps will you take to overcome those "barriers"?


Establish a “master” resume that you’ll customize per employer
Establish “master” cover letter with your key talking points


Utilize a tracking system to keep track of all your company/job outreach, who you talked to, what you learned, and what you’d do differently next time. 
Ensure your Turing Portfolio (http://turing.io/alumni) has your latest work and an accurate list of your desired locations
Ensure your LinkedIn is up to date and indicates that you’re job hunting
Apply to at least 10 companies/jobs and reach out to at least 10 individuals
We expect you to establish a “daily-practice” repository where you’re putting small daily exercises to keep your skills sharp and your GitHub activity chart active



**[Example](https://gist.github.com/kjs222/7ef5e79a71eedf9d8c8d401da1e687c7)** of clearly outlined goals and schedule to complete them.

## Optional Extensions: Furthering your Skills and Contributing to the Developer Community
You're encouraged to pick one of the below options to work on in addition to your plan above. However, this is completely optional.

### Option #1: Side Hustle Plan
What side project(s) do you want to work on? How could you decide on a side project?

Take these steps:

1. Generate and come up with an idea:
	* Read and research -- what problems need solving?
	* Brainstorm -- what's important to you?
	* Have fun! What would be fun and exciting to try out?

2. Document a plan for your side project:
	* What will your MVP look like?
	* When do you want working software by?
	* Who are your users?
	* Etc.

### Option #2: Open Source Project
How do you want to contribute to the developer community? 

* Find an Open Source project couple projects you’d be interested in, why you’re interested, how you would like to contribute

### Option #3: Community Involvement
How do you want to be involved in the developer community?

How you could approach this option:

* Research at least 3 conferences you'd be interested in attending -- what would you get out of them? Do you want to speak at a conference at some point?
* Find 3 new meetups to join -- how could you contribute to those meetups?
* Write 3 new blog posts -- how can you share information with others?
