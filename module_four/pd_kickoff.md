## Opening: The Big Picture
### Objectives
* Understand the scope and sequence of Module 4 Professional Development
* Identify particular strategies for outreach, networking....
* Identify barriers that may come up for you in the job search

### Module 4 Professional Development Scope & Sequence
You're starting your final module at Turing, and we aim to set you up with as much 

### Looking Ahead
In your Module 4 portfolio review, you'll be expected to:

* Submit your [30-day job search action plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md) to discuss at the review
* Give your condensed elevator pitch version of your professional story at the review

You'll also be expected to present your Turing Story, which will be a lightning talk of sorts to describe your Turing journey. Slides are encouraged but optional.

**You Do:** Students skim over the plan and ask any questions that come up (3-5 mins) 

### Professional Development Support Groups & Coaches

[Reference these guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md) to get your group going on the right track. 

### Individual Reflections
Based on what you put in your survey, what made you respond to the "confidence in the job search" question with the number you gave? What do you feel confident in? What do you not feel confident in?

## Strategies & Tools
### Outreach
The number #1 strategy we're going to encourage you to take on in your job search is to pursue relationships over applications. You do this through outreach. Whether it's "warm" outreach in which you utilize your existing network or "cold" outreach in which you initiate contact with someone you haven't met yet, building relationships with others who are already in the technology industry will help you get your foot in the door faster than if you merely submit your resume to online application portals.

To give you a sense of how effective this approach can be, check out [this blog post from 1606-BE alum Jesse Spevack](http://www.jessespevack.com/blog/2017/3/8/get-hired-how-i-went-from-bootcamp-grad-to-engineer) on his job search, specifically on how he utilized outreach in his job search.

**You Do:** Spend 7 minutes reading this blog post (stop at the section that ends immediately before "Technical Challenges") and jot down any points that stick out to you. What parts of Jesse's approach seem doable to you and why? What parts seem daunting to you and why? How can you adapt any of Jesse's advice to your own approach?

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with someone else to share your takeaways from Jesse's blog post.

**Whole Group Discussion:** 
* What value is there in using outreach as a job search strategy?
* What are some ways that you will adapt Jesse's approach in your job search? 2-3 people share out.

Later, you'll use notes that you took here to discuss in your PD peer groups. 

### Networking & Branding
Outreach helps you establish

Meetup, Built In events, networking groups, telling your story, speaking at a Meetup, blogging and social networking...

### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture-based questions)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

**You Do:**
Individually, reflect in your journal on barriers that have come up for you in previous job searches and/or that you anticipate could hold you back in your current job search. 
* Why do you think these barriers occur for you? 
* Have you tried to overcome them in the past? If so, what was effective for you? 
* What kind of support could you use from your peer group to help you move past these barriers? 
Be prepared to share some of this information in your group DTR. 

### Closing: Break into Groups
As you get started with your PD peer groups, start with a DTR to get on the same page about your job search goals, barriers you might place on yourself in this job search, how you want to communicate with each other, and ideas for how you can motivate and hold each other accountable.
