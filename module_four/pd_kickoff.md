## Opening: The Big Picture
### Objectives
* Understand the scope and sequence of Module 4 Professional Development
* 

### Module 4 Professional Development Scope & Sequence


### Looking Ahead
In your Module 4 portfolio review, you'll be expected to:

* Submit your [job search action plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md) to discuss at the review
* Give your condensed elevator pitch version of your professional story at the review

You'll also be expected to present your Turing Story, which will be a lightning talk of sorts to describe your Turing journey. Slides are encouraged but optional

### Professional Development Support Groups & Coaches

[Reference these guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_support_groups.md) to get your group going on the right track. 


## Strategies & Tools
### Outreach
When it comes to your job search, meeting people to have discussions about companies and experiences is much more effective than sending your resume out into the abyss. Creating opportunities to meet those people is where cold outreach and networking come in. The technology industry is a relatively small community, and networking is key to becoming a part of that community.

**Whole Group Discussion:** When you reach out to someone in the industry, what is your purpose? Hint: it's not to ask for a job. 

Suggested purposes:

* Research conversations 
* Tour office
* Hiring junior developers

Most common purpose: Research Conversations -- what is the purpose of these conversations? How can you approach this? 

Here are some [possible questions to ask](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/research_conversation_questions.md)

........

### Networking & Branding

### Technical Interview Prep

### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Cold Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture fit)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

### Closing: Break into Groups

 

### Option 2: Speaking at a Meetup

**Turn & Talk:** What Meetups have you gone to? How have they impacted your learning? How have you learned from other developers thus far in your tech career? 

Whole Group share-out

Chances are, you've learned from other developers' talks and own discoveries in their learning. With this option, you can join the community through giving back. Speaking at a meetup is a very effective way to impart knowledge, gain experience speaking, and provide your career with some exposure. 

#### How to Approach This
Pick a Meetup that you like

OR 

Pick a Meetup that sounds interesting


OR 

Look for kinds of topics have been covered at this Meetup recently -- how could you contribute?

#### Utilize Your Network
* Mentor Ian Douglas frequently includes Turing students and alumni as speakers at the Boulder Python meetup
* See what other meetups that Turing community members are involved in

#### Prepare Your Talk
A great way to approach your talk is to utilize the format of “here’s what I learned when I tried to _______." This is how you've learned from other developers and how they will learn from you. 

More helpful prompts (from this [article](http://www.noelrappin.com/railsrx/2014/1/18/conference-prompts-or-how-to-submit-proposals-and-influence-people)):

* What is the last thing you spent more than 15 minute trying to figure out?
* What is the last tool, process, or code you wrote that made you excited enough to tell somebody else?
* What was the last question you asked a more senior developer?
* What was the last question a more junior developer asked you?
* What do you wish somebody had told you a year ago?
* What was the last blog post or presentation in the community that you disagreed with?
* Do you have a hobby or interest that informs your work?
* What is the best line of code you wrote this week? How could you tell?
* What was something you did for the first time in your last project? How did it work out?
* What was something you did for the last time in your last project (or something you stopped doing for your last project) How did that work out?
* What is a tool or process you would like to learn more about?

##### More Help on Preparing Your Talk:
* Join #speakercorps on Slack to ask questions and get feedback from current students, alumni, and mentors on your talk

#### Contact the Organizers
Reach out to the organizers to find out their upcoming schedule and pitch your talk. Utilize the same cold outreach principles discussed above. 

#### Practice Time
Spend 10 minutes researching meetups and topics that you're interested in speaking on. Begin crafting an outline of a possible talk.

### Option 3: Writing a Technical Blog Post and Showing it Off
Why do developers write blogs? The biggest reason is to **build relationships.** Just as with open source projects, blog posts are another way to share knowledge and invite collaboration from others.

Writing a blog post about your experiences is a valuable way to share your knowledge and build your network. 

Here's how you can do it.

#### Template It Out: Decide What Your Post Is
Start with a template to help define your intent in writing *(adapted from emptysqua.re/blog post “Resources for Writing About Programming” by A. Jesse Jiryu Davis)*

**Disclaimer:** Your blog post does not have to fit into any of these templates. These are just suggestions. 

All of these have a clear opening, body, and closing. No matter how you choose to write your post, you should aim to structure your blog post in a similar fashion -- your reader needs structure to follow your thoughts. 

##### **Story:** 

"I'm going to tell you a story about [blank], how it taught me [blank], and led to [blank]. First this happened, then that happened. And that's the story of [blank]."

Examples:

* I did this project and learned this thing. I found out this thing about myself.
* I used this technology, and here’s what happened.
* I utilized agile practices in this way, and here's what happened. I learned this lesson. 

##### **Opinion:** 

Structure:

1. Thesis 
2. Evidence to support Thesis 
3. Response to likely objections
4. Restate Thesis

Focus on not only having an opinion but also crafting a compelling argument to support it.

Tip: Think about how your experience at Turing has shaped your opinion about how software is developed. 

##### **How-To:**

How-Tos must be motivated by something. Begin by telling your reader when and why this how-to is important to know.

“Doing [blank] is important under the given conditions: [blank]. I’m going to show you how to [blank]. Do this, then do that. There, now I’ve shown you how to [blank]. You should go out and do [blank].”

Hint: Any time you solve a problem, write about how you did it!

##### **How Something Works:**
There doesn’t need to be a clear motivation here other than what are you interested in learning?

When you’re trying to figure out how something works for a project or to describe a project management strategy that you are using in your project, writing an explanation of how it works is a good excuse to dive in and find out more.

“Do you wonder how [blank] works? I’m going to show you how [blank] is implemented. It does this and that. Now I’ve shown you how it works.”

##### **Review:**

Use reviews to describe and analyze instead of evaluating. It’s tempting to evaluate projects or processes on a good-bad axis, but this isn’t very useful. What is this thing *good for?*

“I used or implemented [blank]. This is what it is. This is what my experience was like. [Blank] has these strengths and weaknesses. In conclusion, it’s best when using these certain criteria to evaluate it.”

Now that you have a template, let's talk about the writing process.

### Writing Resources
Writing is like coding -- you have to practice at it. And just like with coding, you should utilize your resources to help you through the writing process:

* [Power Thesaurus](https://www.powerthesaurus.org/): Stuck on a word? Power Thesaurus is a crowdsourced tool that provides users with a ton of alternative word choices from a community of writers.
* [ZenPen](http://www.zenpen.io/): If you're having trouble staying focused, check out this distraction-free writing tool. ZenPen creates a minimalist "writing zone" that's designed to help you get words down without having to fuss with formatting right away.
* [Cliché Finder](http://cliche.theinfo.org/): Feeling like your writing might be coming off a little cheesy? Identify instances where you can be more specific using this handy cliché tool. 
* [Hemingway App](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) -- Analyzes your sentence structures for readability and improvements.
* [Wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/) -- In addition to counting your words, it also calculates reading time.
* [Here are more tools to help you with your writing](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/improving-writing-skills-tools#sm.000013b0c8ho5tdcez8pnsa14dbbn)

#### Utilize Peer Review 
The peer review process is similar to soliciting feedback on a project. As you draft your post, here are some tools to help you stay on top of revisions:

* [Start your draft on Medium](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214874698-Drafts)
* [Share with peers for review](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/215564177-Share-a-draft)
* [Peers can leave feedback through Notes](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214035868)

#### Use Your Network
Now that you have a blog post, you need people to read it! As mentioned above, Medium is an excellent platform to write your blog post on as it's easy to post to other forms of social media or back to your own personal site. 

### Your Turn
Spend 10 minutes choosing a format to write from and begin brainstorming a technical blog post. 

Make sure to solicit feedback from others as you craft this!

### Closing & Next Steps
Decide on a deliverable that you want to pursue, and you'll be expected to turn in one of these options on Monday of Week 5. 

Remember to document your cold outreach and networking opportunities in your Trello board -- this will also make it easier to fill out the deliverable guidelines when you've kept a record of what has happened.
