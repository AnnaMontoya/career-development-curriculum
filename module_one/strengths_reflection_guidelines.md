# Strengths Reflection & Coaching Request


### Read Through Your Theme Definitions

1. What words or phrases stick out to you? How would you define each of your top 5 talents in your own words?



2. Do these top 5 talent themes resonate with you? Why or why not? 

Yes. They're not necessarily things that I didn't know about myself, but they do help me understand why I approach challenges from certain angles, etc.


3. How have you seen yourself using each of these talents? How often do you see yourself using these talents?

I see myself using these talents everyday. They're the things that power both my personal life and professional life. When I was reading the "Achievement" description, it reminded me of my attitude towards working out, and the "Command" description reminded me of my social life. However, talents like "Ideation", "Input", and "Strategic" are probably most prevalent in my work habits.


4. When has it been difficult for me to be aware of this talent?

I am sometimes unaware of these talents when I am in an unfamiliar environment or when I am just beginning to learn new material.

5. What talents could you develop further that would help you in your growth at Turing and in your new career as a software developer?

I think I could continue to develop my communication skills and my positivity in this environment. I get frustrated with myself easily at times (possibly because I'm achievement-driven) and need to learn ways to step away and calm myself.


6. How would you like to build more awareness around these themes?

I think that consciously deciding to work towards building these talents will create more awareness of them in my everyday life. For me, it's a matter of setting aside time out of every day to concentrate on my goals, but also to be present.

7. In which situations would developing these themes be beneficial?

These themes will be beneficial in all situations, whether it's at school, at work, or in my personal life.

8. When might you overuse any of these themes? How might you benefit from dialing it down in a certain situation?

I see a definite negative side to the Achievement theme because it reads to me that you'll never be truly satisfied. I think that I could benefit from taking time to celebrate small victories.

9. How could you use these themes to help you manage an area in which you might struggle?

I could use these themes to become more comfortable in areas in which I am unfamiliar.

10. How can you do more of what you do best every day?

I could practice incorporating the positive sides of these themes in my everyday life and try to establish a balance in order to not overdo them.


### Look at the Suggested Action Items 

11. What options sound doable? 



12. What are some new ways to use these themes that you haven't utilized before?



13. What obstacles are there to trying out any of these options?



14. Shortterm: What is an action step you'd like to commit to help you develop your themes further today? Next week? 



15. Longterm: What do you want to learn this module to turn your talents into greater strengths? How will this help you with your professional or personal goals?


### Repeating the Module
If you've reflected on your StrengthsFinder results previously, here are some additional questions you may want to consider during this second module:

* How did you see yourself using your strengths last module?
* When did you overuse any of your strengths? When did you underuse them?
* What did you realize about yourself both in your struggles and in your wins last module?
* How could you capitalize on your strengths more effectively this time through the module?
* How did working with others last module affect how you understand your strengths?
* What goals for your personal development do you want to make for this module? How will you know if you've achieved them?


### Next Steps
This reflection is for your own growth, and you do not need to turn this in.
