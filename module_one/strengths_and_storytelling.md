#### The Why: Why Telling Your Story is Important
Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? 

In this session and throughout your career development at Turing, we'll focus on how you can craft a compelling story to describe who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community. A long, long time from now, when you are ready to graduate, you will give a lightning talk about your experiences at Turing. Today we are going to start that lightning talk by sharing more about what brought you here and what you hope to accomplish. This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career.

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published [this post](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) with her 22 rules for storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

**Turn & Talk:**

What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it's a story from childhood, maybe it's a book you just finished reading, or maybe it's a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.

**Whole Group Debrief:**

Sharing from 1-2 people:

* What key details do you remember from your partner's story?
* How did your partner tell the story? 
* What made the story interesting?

This brings us to the elements that make up a good story -- what are they?

Possible answers: consistent theme, protagonist who faces and overcomes challenges, a journey of some kind, sequential plot that shows a beginning middle and end.

**Connection to You:**
These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the narrative thread through your own theme.

There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs:
* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

We'll start building our stories by connecting with ourselves through these 3 questions to describe:
* Our backstories
* Our current struggles and successes -- *a turning point*
* Our futures

### Backstories: Who Are You?  
Where have you come from? What lenses do you view the world through? We'll answer these questions through life maps.

**I Do:** Facilitator shows off their life map to demonstrate how to outline one's backstory. Note: this is an opportunity to share information about your backstory and how your highs and lows have shaped your pathway here.

**You Do:** Students spend 10 minutes creating their life maps using the paper and markers provided. 

### Current Struggles and Successes: Why are You Here?
  -Reflect on struggles/values/strengths
   -Share staff members’ stories
-StrengthsFinder in here somewhere...
   -You Do: Answer specific questions in journals to share later, including strengths; peak experience so far at Turing -- how you've seen yourself using one of your strengths; The Reflection
      Becoming more comfortable with owning what we're good at




### Small Group Share

Students will get into groups of 4 to discuss key takeaways from their individual reflection. Each group member should get 3 minutes to talk (uninterrupted about the first two reflection questions). Assign someone to keep time. You will have additional time in your group after everyone shares. With that additional time, discuss your ideas for this final question:

* How can we operate as a community to build on our similarities and learn from our differences?

### Whole Group Share 
1-3 groups' presenters share their groups discussion of *"How do you think these differences/similarites will impact your community?"* 

### Storytelling: Strengths Through Adversity
Another rule from Emma Coats is:

    You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

This is because we want to root for a character to overcome struggles and adversity. Now think about how you've changed and struggled since starting at Turing. How have you worked through those struggles? How have you used your StrengthsFinder themes to do that? How have you succeeded? How did your strengths help you?

#### You Do: Add to your Story
Continue to exercise your storytelling skills by adding to what you've expressed about yourself today. You've defined who you are, now think about how your character has developed thus far at Turing by writing about these 3 areas in a gist for your reflection [using this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_storytelling_reflection.md)

* Write 1-2 paragraphs about your StrengthsFinder themes:
      How have you seen yourself using these strengths at Turing? Has your understanding of these strengths changed since you first reflected on them? If so, how? 
* Write a story about your Turing experience so far:
    When have you struggled? How have you dealt with struggle? When have you succeeded at Turing? How did you accomplish those successes?
* Answer the question: how does your Turing story end? Create a vision for your future and your career transition into being a junior developer.

It's important to remember that each of these pieces of your story is a draft. You're continuing to grow and learn, and thus your story will change. But this is about starting with our first draft and getting better at refining it as we go through the program. 

### Pair Up: Telling Our Stories
Find a partner with which to share your Turing experience. The objective here is to work on telling your story by building in specifics of how you're developing your strengths at Turing. Make sure to include:

* How you're using strengths at Turing
* How you've struggled and/or succeeded at Turing
* What's next for you -- what's your vision?

You'll have 3 minutes to tell your story, and then your partner will give you 1 minute of feedback on what they heard and ask clarifying questions. Do they have a clear understanding of your story based on how you told it?

Then you'll switch. We'll do 2 rounds of sharing to practice our storytelling skills. 

### Whole Group Share Out
Share takeaways from your sharing experience:

* What was easy about this?
* What was difficult?
* What else do you want to keep in mind when it comes to telling your story?

### Work on Lightning Talk Slides 
As your prepare for graduation, you'll be asked to tell the story of your Turing experience in a 5-minute Lightning Talk. Today we will start preparing the slides that you will use for that talk.  In your notebooks, write about how you would design slides and what you would want to be on the slides. Consider how particular images contribute to telling your story.  These are three slides you should focus on at this time:

* Where are you from?
* What brought you to Turing?
* What do you hope to accomplish during your time here?

Examples of presentation slides: 

* [Matt Kaufman, 1608-FE](http://slides.com/mattkaufman/deck#/)
* [Ali Schlereth, 1608-BE](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Ali_LightningTalk.pdf)
* [Noah Berman, 1608-BE](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/noah_berman_last_day_presentation.pdf)

### Closing

On graduation day, cohorts have the opportunity to share their reflections on their time here.  Over and over again, students comment that they wish they had shared more of their stories sooner, that they wish they had spent more time understanding each other and what experiences brought each person here. Consider ways that you can share your stories, the things that you value, and what you are hoping for in the upcoming weeks. The more connections you can make, the better you will be able to work together towards success.
