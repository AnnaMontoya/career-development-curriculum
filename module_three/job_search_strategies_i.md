### Opening
This job search brings up a lot of questions:

* What do you want to do?
	* What do you want from your career in the longterm?
	* On a daily basis? 
* What areas do you consider your expertise?
	* How do your current projects show that?
* How will you contribute to the software industry in the future?
	* What is in your comfort zone and toolbox already?
	* How will you push yourself?
* Logistics:
	* When do you need a job by? 
	* What steps do you need to take to secure that job?

Trying to answer all of these questions at once can feel overwhelming, but in this session, we'll discuss how you can pull together all the professional development pieces you've worked on this module (your resume, your professional story, your flower exercise, your research, your job shadowing experience) to help you answer these questions one by one.

### Objectives
* Identify your top priorities in your job search
* Identify your industry expertise at this point in the program
* Describe how you'd like to contribute to the software industry and make plan that relies on your current expertise and will push you to do more in Module 4
* Decide when you will need to complete you job search and what steps are needed to make that happen

### Deliverables
* Complete your resume edits
* Complete your Turing portfolio
* Complete PD Peer Groups Survey

### Decide on Priorities: What do you want to do (longterm)? 
The Flower Exercise forced you to take a deeper dive into what skills, knowledge, and values have informed your professional journey thus far, and we'll build on those reflections to analyze how our career could provide us with the opportunities we seek. 

How can you do that? Start by looking at your completed Flower Exercise. What bullet points stick out to you as most important in describing who you are? How can you take the most important bullets and combine them into a career you love?

**I Do:** Allison will model how she might create a professional summary about herself using her Flower Exercise:

* I value helping others reach their fullest potential, and my skills in coaching, active listening, and providing feedback ensure that I can be successful in a career that does just that. For my next job search, my priorities are to find a job that combines my passion and knowledge around curriculum-planning to coach others on a wider spectrum, and I also hope to do this work in a way that provides the right work-life balance to allow me to pursue my passion for writing as well. 

### Your Turn
**Write:** Spend five minutes analyzing your Flower Exercise and list your biggest priorities in the job search based on what you've discovered. Priorities could include: physical location, industry, size of company, team culture, diversity makeup, technologies, flexibility, salary amount, types of benefits, mentorship, etc. 

### Decide on Priorities: What do you want to do (on a daily basis)?
Using what you just discussed, think about what this can look like in a day-to-day job. Then create two columns, labelled "Must-Have" and "Nice-To-Have":

* If you could only have five of those things, which five would it be?
* Move the rest to the "Nice-to-Have" list
* If you could only have one of the things in your list of five, which would it be?
* Prioritize based on how you narrowed it down and identify why they are prioritized in this order

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with someone else to share your priorities, both for your longterm career and your "must-haves." Your partner will repeat back to you what they heard you say in order to convey how clear this list is. Do your partner's "must-haves" align with their goals and career trajectory? 

### Show Your Expertise: Your Projects & Portfolio
You've completed almost three out of four modules of this program, and you've made A LOT of progress -- *you're ready to share this expertise with the world!* The first way you'll do this is through your [Turing portfolio](turing.io/alumni). You'll discuss this portfolio with your instructors during your end-of-module portfolio review. This is an excellent opportunity to:

* Own the progress that you've made and your expertise
* Practice talking about yourself
* Practice describing a project

**You Do:** Prepare to defend your Turing portfolio.  Reflect on the projects you've worked on and which specific project you've chosen to highlight on your Turing portfolio.

* What is your area of expertise (where are you strongest)?
* Why did you pick this particular project?
* How does it show what you know?
* How could you describe this project to a potential employer in a synthesized way?

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with a new partner to discuss your expertise and present your project and portfolio as though you are talking to a potential employer. Your partner will give you feedback on how well they understood your project and what you are an expert in. 

### Future Contributions: Claim Your Place in the Industry
