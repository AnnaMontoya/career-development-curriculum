### Opening
Staying organized at Turing can be challenging for even the most put-together person. Between deadlines, constant messages, and various priorities, there's a lot to juggle. This session is focused on providing you with tools to manage various aspects of organization more successfully. 

Objectives of this session:
* Assess how you're doing in certain areas of organization
* Explore tools to help with managing deadlines, notifications, and workflow
* Commit to action steps to improve your organizational skills

Relating back to the mission: *Turing's mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.* In this session, we're focused on this "unlocking human potential" piece because we can all become better organized by incorporating some intentional strategies!

### Self-Assessment 
Take this [self-assessment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zz8z01As0hvmPDRFfYtkw6tLrQwDOAdu5K4cRkuwZ1o/edit?usp=sharing) to reflect on your current organizational practices. Use the following rating to assess your answers:

| 3            | Sometimes    |
| 4            | Often        |

10. I use a project/time management tool such as a planner, calendar, checklist, etc.

### Turn & Talk
Share your concerns with organization from self-assessment with a partner. Consider these questions:
* How did you feel about your answers?
* What concerns do you have based on this assessment?
* What are some areas that you feel like you could improve in based on this assessment?

### Using Calendars, Planners, and To-Do Lists Effectively: I Do, Students work independently to set up a system
First things first, staying organized comes down to the tools that you use. There are a wide variety of tools out there than can help you stay organized, but the most important thing is to find 1 tool that works for you. 

#### Calendars
Let's start by looking at calendars. I recommend using Google Calendar because you can easily sync it with the Turing module calendars. You can create different calendars for different purposes if you'd prefer to keep your work life separate from your home life. Here are [directions](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37095?hl=en) on how to set up separate calendars. 

**Tips for using a calendar effectively:**
* Sync with other calendars to see how their events match up with your schedule. To add a Turing module or the community calendar, navigate to your program's site:
    * [backend.turing.io](backend.turing.io)
    * [frontend.turing.io](frontend.turing.io)
Find the relevant calendar and click on the plus in the bottom right of the calendar:

* Add events as needed to keep track of appointments, deadlines, and to create specific timeboxes to get tasks done 
* Enable notifications so that you can be reminded of pending appointments. Navigate to "My Calendars" on the lefthand side of the screen, click on the dropdown arrow, and click on "Edit Notifications." After you set the timing on notifications that will work best for you, you can also decide how you'd like to receive that notification back on the "General" screen.

#### Beyond Calendars
There are other organizational systems that could be helpful for you to keep your 

#### Going Analog
Using a physical planner can be a great way to keep track of deadlines and task lists through a system that you can design. There is also something very satisfying about writing something down and being able to check it off later. 

**[Bullet Journals](http://bulletjournal.com/)** are a way that you can use a physical planner in a method similar to a    Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM) to see how it can work. 

Intros to Trello, 

#### Virtual To-Do Lists
* Todoist
* Wunderlist

#### Bookmarks
As you compile notes and resources from your many web searches  **Google Keep** is a great organizer for bookmarks. Add it as an extension on your browser...

** You Do:** Make plans to set up a system right now. If you're already using a system, consider ways of making it more productive. Consider:

* What is most meaningful to you when it comes to organizing your priorities? What system will have the most motivation for you?
* 


### Workflow: I do, Then Group Discussion

Pomodoros

Small Group Discussion:

* What have been your blockers to managing workflow in the past?
* What is difficult about taking breaks?
* What are your takeaways about Pomodoros?
* How might you adopt some of these ideas into your workflow?

### Managing Messages & Notifications in Slack: Whole Group, "Code Along"
Slack is Turing's main mode of communication, so we expect students to be checking it regularly. However, with all the channels and notifications, how can you keep it all straight?

Start by setting up your notifications. Hit ```command ,``` to open up Notifications:

So now, when you receive a DM, you'll be able to ...


While [this tutorial](https://vimeo.com/157164958) was made in an earlier version of Slack's interface, it includes all the same information as a helpful refresher from today's session.

### Commitment to Action
Individually, decide what changes you will commit to in order to improve your organizational skills. 

Reflect on these questions:

*
* How will you know that you've made progress in this area? Is there anyone you will check in with to hold you accountable? 

### Closing
2-3 students share out their action steps
